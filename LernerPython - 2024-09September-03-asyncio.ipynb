    "\n",
    "Two related terms in programming:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Concurrency -- a more general term meaning that we can benefit from pieces of our program executing semi-independently, even if they're not truly indepent of one another\n",
    "- Parallelism -- running multiple parts of our program in parallel\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "- If I want read from 10 different files, then I might want to use parallelism -- each core on my system can read a different file\n",
    "- If I want to download data from 10 different URLs, this also might be possible with parallelism\n",
    "- If I have only one core, but I'm reading from 10 different files, I can still use concurrency -- because I can ask for data from one file, and while that data is coming to me, I can then turn to another file and ask for its data. This works because I know that it'll take a while for the data to come from any one of those files.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that all of these examples are for problems that are I/O-bound, meaning that the bottleneck is basically that we're reading from disks/networks/etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "What if I wanted to perform a very big, difficult calculation like MD5 or SHA1, or bitcoin mining? Can I break any of those into pieces, and have them shared across CPUs? No. Those are CPU-bound problems. \n",
    "\n",
    "Over the years, we've had two main ways to get concurrency/parallelism in Python:\n",
    "- Multiprocessing -- allows us to start new processes, split our work across them, and even join the results together."
